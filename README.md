# Memory Game Project

## Instructions
"Memory Game" is similiar to the game "Concentration" - your goal is to match all the cards.
Every turn will be counted and the timer goes off after opening the first card. 

**Make sure you get the best score you can ;)**

For every turn you can only open two cards, which will be compared if they are a match or not.
A match is achieved by opening two cards with the same symbol. These will remain open while cards that are not a match will be closed again. 

Have fun and good luck!
