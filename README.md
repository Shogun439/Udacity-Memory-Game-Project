Memory Game is similiar to the game "Concentration" - your goal is to match all the cards.
Every turn will be counted and the timer goes off after opening the first card.
For every turn you can only open two cards, which will be compared if they are a match or not.
A match is achieved by opening two cards with the same symbol. These will remain open while cards that are not a match will be closed again. **Make sure you get the best score you can ;)**

Have fun and good luck!
